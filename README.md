In today's digital era, conversational AI technologies play a crucial role in enhancing user
engagement and providing valuable information to users. In this project, I present the
development of a question-answering (QA) chatbot designed specifically for a museum setting.
The chatbot leverages retrieval-based techniques to provide accurate and informative responses
to user queries regarding museum-related topics.
 
The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly and efficient QA chatbot that can
assist visitors with inquiries related to the museum's exhibits, history, and services. The chatbot
aims to enhance the overall visitor experience by providing prompt and accurate responses to a
wide range of questions.

Web scraping is a technique used to extract data or content from websites for various purposes,
such as data analysis, research, or archiving. In this report, I present a Python script developed
for web scraping purposes.
