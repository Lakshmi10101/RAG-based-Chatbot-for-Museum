Mithuna
TC 313
DESCRIPTION
A carved brick depicting an amorous couple (Mithuna)
The pair of male and female in Indian art has a much wider connotation than lust as sexual or procreative partners. They are also partners in religious duties such as the performance of important ceremonies and rituals to acquire religious merit. In fact, no Grihya and other sacrifices could be performed by a single man, as it was considered, incomplete. Yugala or Mithuna symbolised completeness or totality of life and therefore is considered auspicious. The presence of Mithuna sculptures on Indian temples reflects the partnership of man and woman both in the act of dharma and karma. This concept is emphatically expressed even in the Rig veda wherein it is stated: "they accompanied by their wives, worshipped the fire who is worthy of worship." The Dharmashastras also enjoin that from the time of marriage the husband and wife work together for the ultimate fulfilment of life.

Buddhaâ€™s Birth
TC 83
DESCRIPTION
The brick, within a single panel, depicts one of Buddha's twelve exemplary deeds, that is, his birth in the Lumbini forest. Queen Mayadevi, Shakyamuni's mother, can be observed standing while holding a branch with her right hand. To her right is a row of attendants receiving the infant, the future Buddha, emerging from her side. The attendants can be seen wearing a cap-like headdress and single-stranded necklaces, while Mayadevi herself can be seen wearing a crown, a necklace, armbands, and wristbands. The Altdanakatha elaborates on the tale behind this object. While travelling back to her parent's palace to give birth, in keeping with the custom, Mayadevi was struck by the beauty of the Lumbini forest. Standing amidst the trees, she held a branch, and at that moment began experiencing labour pains, with the future Buddha being born soon after. There have been many conjectures aiming to explain Mayadevi's pose.

Jambhala (Kubera)
TC 80
DESCRIPTION
This roundel of Kubera, the God of wealth and also the guardian of the western (north) direction was placed on the west wall of the stupa, which was probably the front side of the monument. Pot-bellied Kubera is seated in the midst of acanthus leaves, a style peculiar to the Mirpur Khas artist. The curves of the leaves gracefully blend and harmonise with the folds of his garments. He wears a three-peaked tiara, necklace, big earrings, a kamarabandha and armlets and holds a singular emblem of the lotus in his hand. His hair falls in neatly organised tassels right below his shoulders. He is seated in the Ardhaparyankasana slightly leaning to his right aligning with the curve of the roundel. The image is important as one of the early representations of Kubera. Besides being auspicious. The roundel must have also served as a decorative piece on the outer wall of the stupa.

Carved Brick
TC 67
DESCRIPTION
The use of decorative bricks was in fashion during the Gupta period, particularly around Punjab and north-western India. Many brick temples from Kot in Punjab to Mirpur Khas in Sindh, and from Bhitargaon to Sirpur testify to the ample use of bricks with decorative designs in contemporary architecture. These bricks vary in size, measuring between 6 to 18 inches in length. The variety of their patterns is infinite, suitable for the embellishment of different parts of the architecture. The extant site gives a fairly good idea of the original arrangement of the bricks on the stupa.

DESCRIPTION
Jade is a semi-precious stone used to produce exquisite and innumerable works of art. It is hard and glassy with a translucent surface and comes in various shades. The process of jade carving is time-consuming and requires a lot of patience.
The Mughal jades were well known for their worksmanship. These jades received accolades from the Chinese Emperor Chien Lung (1736- 1795 CE). The emperor notes that the jades from Hindustan are as thin as paper and that only the jade carvers from Hindustan are capable of creating such exquisite pieces.
